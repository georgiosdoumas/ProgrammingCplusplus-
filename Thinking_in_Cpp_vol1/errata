//: C03:gotoKeyword.cpp in paragraph Using and misusing goto
//The advice mentioned in the book after the example is not well expressed.
//It says in the text 
"The alternative would be to set a Boolean that is tested in the outer for loop, and then do a break from the inner for loop."
//but in reality it should say :
The alternative would be to set a Boolean that is tested in the inner for loop, and then do a break from the outer for loop.
//See my implementation in example gotoKeyword2.cpp under chap03


//: C03:Mathops.cpp
// A macro to display a string and a value.
#define PRINT(STR, VAR) cout << STR << " = " << VAR << endl  
//here the webpage has it wrong as:  
//#define PRINT(STR, VAR) cout << STR " = " << VAR << endl  


// Chapter 6 Aggregate Initialization :
int c[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
Now if you decide to add another element to the array, you simply add another initializer.
//I do not think that the above sentence is valid. The array is fixed to have 4 elements and cannot be expanded.
