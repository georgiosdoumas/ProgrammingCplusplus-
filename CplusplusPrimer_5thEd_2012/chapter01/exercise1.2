//No include statements yet for this simple program
//I played around putting various negative values on the return statement
int main()
{
    return -1;
}

//so because I wanted to change the line of retunr to various values , like 
// return -2
// return -3 
// and then examine the value that the linux system has for the last executed program , with
// echo $? 
// I created a small bash script to build,run and examine the $? , after each change I did on the value of return

#!/bin/bash
# build , run and examine the value of echo $?
