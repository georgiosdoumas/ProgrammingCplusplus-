/* Exercise 1.2: Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often treated
as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your program to see how
your system treats a failure indicator from main.*/

//No include statements yet for this simple program
//I played around putting various negative values on the return statement
int main()
{
    return -1;
}

// I wanted to change the line of return to various values , like 
// return -2
// return -3 
// and then examine the value that the linux system has for the last executed program , with
// echo $? 
// so I created a small bash script to build,run and examine the $? , after each change I did on the value of return

#!/bin/bash
# build , run and examine the value of echo $?
