/* Exercise 7.26: Define Sales_data::avg_price as an inline function.
 The programs youâ€™ve written to use Sales_data operations should still continue to work.
Recompile those programs with your new class definition to verify that they still work. */
// So what I am doing now is taking the file Exercise7.21functions.cpp and modifying it.
// I am adding my data member for the title of the book, an extra string compared to the books implementation
// and do the inline that exercise7.26 wants

#include <iostream>
#include <string> 
#include "Exercise7.26class.h"

    units_sold += rhs.units_sold; 
    revenue += rhs.revenue;

{
    if (units_sold) return revenue/units_sold;
     else return 0;
}
//Now 3 functions that are class-related, but non-member (they are part of the interface,but not the class implementation) :
istream &read(istream &is, Sales_data &item)  //has been declared outside of class block, we define it here
{
    double price = 0;
    is >> item.bookNo >> item.bookTitle >> item.units_sold >> price;
    item.revenue = price * item.units_sold;
    return is;
}
ostream &print(ostream &os, const Sales_data &item)
{
    os << item.title() << " with ISBN:"<< item.isbn() << " sold units:" << item.getunitsold() 
        << ", so the average price is $ " << item.avg_price() << " and you earned a total of:" << item.getrevenue();
    return os;
}
Sales_data add(const Sales_data &lhs, const Sales_data &rhs)
