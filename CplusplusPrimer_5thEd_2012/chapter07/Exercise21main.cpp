/* Exercise 7.21: Update your Sales_data class to hide its implementation. The programs 
youâ€™ve written to use Sales_data operations should still continue to work.
Recompile those programs with your new class definition to verify that they still work. */
// I have Exercise7.12-Exercise7.13 as base for editing
// but I chose to vary a little from what the book does on page 269 , 7.2.1 Friends
// There the book makes 3 functions as friends, but because I am solving this exercise after solving 7.22
// and in 7.22 I got the idea to declare some more functions for accessing members , I also want to try this here.
// So I only make friend the function that needs to access the members in order to change them , which is the read()
// The others I leave them as non-friends , and have them use the extra getSomething() functions that I define
// I really do not know at this point which is considered best practice !!! But the program compiles and runs.
// NOTE : I also practiced the seperation of files. Now this seperation actually seems usefull, because I have reached the point
// that if I want to change the class implementation, or the functions implementation, I should not need to edit anything on the 
// file with the main() program.

#include <string>
