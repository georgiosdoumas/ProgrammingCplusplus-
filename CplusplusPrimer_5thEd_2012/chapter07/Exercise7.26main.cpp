/* Exercise 7.26: Define Sales_data::avg_price as an inline function.
 The programs youâ€™ve written to use Sales_data operations should still continue to work.
Recompile those programs with your new class definition to verify that they still work. */
// So what I am doing now is taking the file Exercise7.21main.cpp and modifying it.
// I am adding my data member for the title of the book, an extra string compared to the books implementation
// and do the inline that exercise7.26 wants
// The gain here is that I do not have to change the code in main(), only include the new changed header and recompile
// with the new implementation file Exercise7.26functions.cpp

#include <iostream>

/*
The input file here again has a single word (no spaces) for the title. 
I was not able to implement a solution where the title could be a string with many words :
